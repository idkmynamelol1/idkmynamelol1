HI!! I'm a C++ Developer working with SFML, OpenGL, and Dev-C++
I like kittens cuz they're adorable and I am semi decent at coding :3 (I am not a furry I just like kittens)

I hereby give permission to anybody to use and reuse my code in all and any projects apart from ones associated with illegal activity.

I'm currently using SFML and trying to figure out how the hell OpenGL works.
